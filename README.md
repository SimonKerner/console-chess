# Chess Game for Console

<p>
  A simple console-based chess game that implements OOP principles. This game was written in Java and was one of my very first programming projects.

## Instructions

<p>
  Initially, two players are required. After starting the program, a short greeting appears, as well as a request that the two players should decide who will be "Player
  1" and who will be "Player 2". After pressing the 'Enter' key, the players are assigned random colors. Once this is done, you will be asked to press the 'Enter' key
  again so that the game can start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each player starts with 16 pieces (1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights and 8 pawns) in their respective color.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  The game is played alternately, with the white player always making the first move. 
  <br><br>
  The pieces are moved by entering the desired coordinates. 
  <br>
  1. First you enter the coordinate of the desired piece ("c2") into the console and confirm it with the "Enter" key. 
  <br>
  2. Then you enter the coordinate of the target point ("c4") and confirm again with the "Enter" key.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game continues alternately until one of the players is checkmated. Checkmate is the player who cannot free himself from a mate situation and protect his
  threatened king. A player can still get out of a checkmate situation by moving his king to a non-threatened square or by capturing the attacking piece.
